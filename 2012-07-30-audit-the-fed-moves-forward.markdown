title: Audit the Fed Moves Forward!

Last week the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed my
legislation calling for a full and effective audit of the Federal
Reserve.  Well over 300 of my Congressional colleagues supported the
bill, each casting a landmark vote that marks the culmination of decades
of work.  We have taken a big step toward bringing transparency to the
most destructive financial institution in the world. 

But in many ways our work is only beginning.  Despite the Senate
Majority Leader’s [past
support](http://j.mp/U4bDlO)
for similar legislation, no vote has been scheduled on my bill this year
in the Senate.  And only [29
Senators](http://j.mp/U4bDlP) have
cosponsored Senator Rand Paul’s version of my bill in the other body. 
If your Senator is not listed at the link above, please contact them and
ask for their support.  We need to push Senate leadership to hold a vote
this year. 

Understand that last week’s historic vote never would have taken place
without the efforts of millions of Americans like you, ordinary citizens
concerned about liberty and the integrity of our currency.  Political
elites respond to political pressure, pure and simple.  They follow
rather than lead.  If all 100 Senators feel enough grassroots pressure,
they will respond and force Senate leadership to hold what will be a
very popular vote.

In fact, "Audit the Fed" is so popular that 75% of all Americans support
it according to this [Rasmussen
poll](http://j.mp/U4bDlQ). 
We are making progress.

Of course Fed apologists-- including Mr. Bernanke-- frequently insist
that the Fed already is audited.  But this is true only in the sense
that it produces annual financial statements.  It provides the public
with its balance sheet as a fait accompli: we see only the net results
of its financial transactions from the previous fiscal year in broad
categories, and only after the fact.

We’re also told that the Dodd-Frank bill passed in 2010 mandates an
audit.  But it provides for only a limited audit of certain Fed credit
facilities surrounding the crisis period of 2008.  It is backward
looking, which frankly is of limited benefit.

The Fed also claims it wants to be "independent" from Congress so that
politics don’t interfere with monetary policy.  This is absurd for two
reasons. 

First, the Fed already is inherently and unavoidably political.  It made
a political decision when it chose not to rescue Lehman Brothers in
2008, just as it made a political decision to provide liquidity for AIG
in the same time period. These are just two obvious examples.  Also Fed
member banks and the Treasury Department are full of former-- and
future-- Goldman Sachs officials.  Are we really to believe that the
interests of Goldman Sachs have absolutely no effect on Fed decisions?
Clearly it’s naïve to think the Fed somehow is above political or
financial influence.

Second, it’s important to remember that Congress created the Fed by
statute.  Congress therefore has the full, inherent authority to
regulate the Fed in any way-- up to and including abolishing it
altogether.

My bill provides for an ongoing, thorough audit of what the Fed really
does in secret, which is make decisions about the money supply, interest
rates, and bailouts of favored banks, financial firms, and companies. 
In other words, I want the Government Accountability Office to examine
the Fed’s actual monetary policy operations and make them public. 

It is precisely this information that must be made public because it so
profoundly affects everyone who holds, saves, or uses US dollars.
