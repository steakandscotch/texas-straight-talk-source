Last week the House passed yet another bill placing sanctions on Iran
and Syria, bringing us closer to another war in the Middle East. We are
told that ever harsher sanctions finally will force the targeted nations
to bend to our will.  Yet the ineffectiveness of previous sanctions
teaches us nothing; in truth sanctions lead to war more than they
prevent war.

Until last year, Libyan sanctions were touted as a great success story. 
The regime would change its behavior. Yet NATO bombed the country
anyway.

Last week we learned that President Obama signed an intelligence
"finding" directing the CIA to covertly assist rebels in Syria. The
administration seems determined to fight yet another war in Syria that
has nothing to do with American national interests.\
We already know that a similar "finding" was signed under the latest
Bush administration directing US intelligence to undermine the Iranian
government and promote regime change there. Neoconservatives have long
demanded that we overthrow the Syrian government before moving on to war
against Iran.  This bellicosity continues regardless of which party is
in the White House.

In Syria we see once again we see how our interventionist policies
backfire and make us less secure.  Recent news reports point to ties
between the Syrian opposition and al-Qaeda (and other extremist
groups).  A [recent
article](http://j.mp/U4bDlR)
in the Guardian, a British newspaper, exclaimed that, "Al-Qaida turns
tide for rebels in battle for eastern Syria."  The article quotes an
al-Qaeda leader in Syria saying that he meets with the main US-backed
Syrian rebel organization, the Free Syrian Army, "almost every day."  So
by promoting civil war in Syria we end up fueling al-Qaeda.

According to another recent press report, German intelligence services
estimate that nearly 100 terrorist attacks have been committed by
al-Qaeda or related organizations in Syria over the past six months.
Last month a suicide bomber in Syria killed a defense minister and
several top government officials. The US government, which has been
fighting a "War on Terror" for more than a decade now, refused to
condemn that act of terrorism.

This raises the question of whether the US administration is supporting
the same people in Syria that we have been fighting in Iraq and
Afghanistan. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed these same
concerns [earlier this
year](http://j.mp/U4bFdy) when asked
whether the US has been reluctant to arm the Syrian rebels. She
answered, "To whom are you delivering them? We know al-Qaida. Zawahiri
is supporting the opposition in Syria. Are we supporting al-Qaida in
Syria?"

That is a very good question.  It clearly demonstrates that the United
States has no business at all being involved in the Syrian civil war. In
the 1980s we supported a resistance movement in Afghanistan that later
gave birth to elements of al-Qaeda and the Taliban. When will we learn
our lesson and stop intervening in conflicts we donâ€™t truly understand,
conflicts that have nothing to do with American national interests?
