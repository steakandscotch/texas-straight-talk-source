French businessman and economist [Jean-Baptiste Say](http://j.mp/U4bFub) is
credited with identifying the fundamental economic principle that aggregate
demand for goods in an economy will equal the aggregate supply of goods when
markets are permitted to operate. Or in Say’s words, "products are paid for
with products."

English classical economist [David Ricardo](http://j.mp/U4bDCw), among others,
more fully developed this principle into what has become known as "[Say’s Law."
](http://j.mp/U4bDCx) Say’s Law, according to Ricardo, leads us to understand
that market equilibrium for goods is constant. This simply means that markets,
when left alone by government planners or other fraudulent actors, inexorably
tend toward an "equilibrium price" which eventually balances supply and demand
for any particular good. Thus [markets will clear](http://j.mp/U4bFKu)
themselves of any surpluses or shortages in the form of excess supply and
demand.

This important corollary of Say’s Law-- that markets clear-- is critical
to understanding the moribund US housing market.  In housing, perhaps
more than any other good, we see the terrible consequences of government
and central bank interference with market forces. 

First, the Federal Reserve Bank relentlessly [increased the money
supply](http://j.mp/U4bFKv) over the last few decades. Much of this newly
created money and credit flowed from Fed member banks into the residential and
commercial real estate markets, causing prices to rise dramatically prior to
the housing bust of 2007.

At the same time, the Fed systematically suppressed [interest rates for
decades](http://j.mp/U4bFKw). This led to tremendous malinvestment both by
homebuilders and individuals, and encouraged a seedy subprime mortgage industry
to make nonviable loans that would not make economic sense under market
interest rates.

Congressional meddling in the mortgage market also added tremendously to
the problem. Inane legislation like The Community Reinvestment Act
literally forced banks to make thousands of loans to bad credit risks. 
Similarly, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac put taxpayers on the hook for
millions of mortgages that never would meet market underwriting
criteria.  And of course the real estate and homebuilder lobbies made
sure mortgage interest debt (unlike most personal debt) remains
tax-deductible.

The ultimate result of these interventions by our caring friends in
Congress and the Fed has been the biggest housing bubble and crash in US
history, leaving millions of Americans underwater on their mortgages if
they have not already lost their houses altogether.  Congress and the
Fed are directly responsible for millions of shattered lives, and almost
unknowable economic damage in the form of trillions of dollars in
mortgage backed securities.

The only solution to this mess is to allow the US housing market to
clear.  All of the bad mortgage debt must be liquidated, whether via
foreclosure or bankruptcy.  Banks holding substantial mortgages or
mortgage backed assets must face the music and adjust their balance
sheets to reflect today’s reality.  Undoubtedly this will force many
banks into immediate insolvency, but such banks must be allowed to fail
without receiving another nickel of taxpayer money.  Banks took the
risks and made money during the bubble years; those who exercised bad
judgment must now accept the consequences of their actions.

Never in American history have we needed to adopt a policy of laissez
faire more desperately; never has government seemed more determined to
artificially prop up an industry.  But only by allowing the housing
market to clear can we hope to rebuild our shattered economy from a
stable foundation.  Clearly there will be pain in the short term, but we
owe it to younger Americans and future generations to allow the
reemergence of a rational housing market.
