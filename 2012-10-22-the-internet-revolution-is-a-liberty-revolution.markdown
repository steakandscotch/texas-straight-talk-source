Until the late 1990s, individuals interested in Austrian economics, U.S.
constitutional history, and libertarian philosophy had few sources of
information.  They had to spend hours scouring used book stores or the
back pages of obscure libertarian periodicals to find the great works of
Mises, Rothbard, Hayek, and other giants of liberty.  Local library and
university collections ignored libertarian politics and economics. 

Today, however, the greatest classics of libertarian thought,
libertarian philosophy, and libertarian economics are available
instantly to anyone with internet access.  Thanks to the internet, it is
easier than ever before for liberty activists to spread news and other
information regarding the evils of government power and the benefits of
freedom.  For the first time in human history, supporters of liberty
around the world can share information across borders quickly and
cheaply.  Without the filter of government censors, this information
emboldens millions to question governments and promote liberty. 

This is why liberty-minded Americans must do everything possible to
oppose-- and stop-- government attempts to censor or limit the free flow
of information online.

One such attempt is known as "CISPA", or the **Cyber Intelligence
Sharing and Protection Act**. This bill will create a monstrous
coalition of big business and big government to rob Americans of their
protections under the 4^th^ Amendment of the Constitution.

CISPA permits both the federal government and private companies to view your
private online communications with **no judicial oversight**, provided they
merely do so in the name of "cybersecurity." But **America is a constitutional
republic, not a surveillance state**-- and the wildly overhyped need for
security does not trump the Constitution.

**"Cybersecurity" is the responsibility of companies that operate and
make money in cyberspace, not taxpayers.**  Those companies should
develop market-based private solutions to secure their networks,
servers, cloud data centers, and user/customer information.  The role of
the US intelligence community is to protect the United States from
military threats, not to provide corporate welfare to the private
sector.  Much like the TSA at the airport, CISPA would socialize
security costs and remove market incentives for private firms to protect
their own investments.

Imagine security-cleared agents embedded at private companies to serve
as conduits for intelligence information about their customers back to
the US intelligence community-- while enjoying immunity from any
existing civil or criminal laws. Imagine Google or Facebook reporting
directly to the National Security Agency about the online activity of US
citizens.  Imagine US government resources being wasted on a grand scale
to "assist" private companies in the global market.  All of this would
become reality under CISPA.

As of this writing, it appears that the House and Senate will not agree
on a final version of CISPA this year. However, the Obama administration
seems ready to impose provisions of this bill by executive order if
Congress does not act soon. 

The past five years have seen an explosion in the liberty movement,
fueled in large part by the internet. Preserving that freedom is crucial
if the liberty movement is to continue its progress. Therefore, all
activists in the liberty movement have a stake in the battle for
internet freedom. We must be ready to come together to fight any attempt
to increase governmentâ€™s power over the internet, regardless of the
supposed justifications. We must resist voices from both the political
right and left which alternatively seek to legislate morality or enforce
political correctness with force.   Copyright protection, pornography,
cyberterrorism, gambling, and "hate speech" are merely excuses for doing
what all governments have done throughout human history: increase their
size, scope, and power. 

Once we understand this, we understand the critical link between
internet freedom and human freedom.
