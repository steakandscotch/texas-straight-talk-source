It is not too often I am pleased by the foreign policy announcements
from this administration, but last week's announcement that the war in
Iraq was in its final stage and all the troops may be home for
Christmas did sound promising. I have long said that we should simply
declare victory and come home. It should not have taken us nearly a
decade to do so, and it was supposed to be a priority for the new
administration. Instead, it will be one of the last things done before
the critical re-election campaign gets into full swing. Better late
than never, but, examining the fine print, is there really much here to
get excited about? Are all of our men and women really coming home, and
is Iraq now to regain its sovereignty? And in this time of economic
crisis, are we going to stop hemorrhaging money in Iraq? Sadly, it
doesn't look that way.

First and foremost, any form of withdrawal that is happening is not
simply because the administration realized it was the right thing to
do.  This is not the fulfillment of a campaign promise, or because
suddenly the training of their police and military is complete and Iraq
is now safe and secure, but because of disagreements with the new
government over a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA).  The current
agreement was set up by the previous administration to expire at the end
of 2011.  Apparently the Iraqis refused to allow continued immunity from
prosecution for our forces for any crimes our soldiers might commit on
Iraqi soil.  Can you imagine having foreign soldiers here, with immunity
from our laws and Constitution, with access to your neighborhood?

Some 39,000 American troops will supposedly be headed home by the end of
the year.  However, the US embassy in Iraq, which is the largest and
most expensive in the world, is not being abandoned.  Upwards of 17,000
military personnel and private security contractors will remain in Iraq
to guard diplomatic personnel, continue training Iraqi forces, maintain
"situational awareness" and other functions.  This is still a
significant American footprint in the country.  And considering that a
private security contractor costs the US taxpayer about three times as
much as a soldier, we're not going to see any real cost savings.  Sadly,
these contractors are covered under diplomatic immunity, meaning the
Iraqi people will not get the accountability that they were hoping for.

While I applaud the spirit of this announcement - since all our troops
should come home from overseas -  I have strong reservations about any
actual improvements in the situation in Iraq, since plans are already
being made to increase the number of troops in surrounding
regions.  What we really need is a new foreign policy and there is no
indication that that is what we have gotten.  On the contrary, the
administration fully intends to keep troops in Iraq, indefinitely, under
a new agreement, while the Iraqis are doing their best to assert their
sovereignty and kick us out.  Neither are we going to be saving any
significant amount of money.  My greatest fear, however, is that this
troop withdrawal from Iraq will simply pave the way for more endless,
wasteful, needless wars.
