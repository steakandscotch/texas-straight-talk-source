The media insists on characterizing statements about dependency on
government handouts as controversial, but in truth such statements are
absolutely correct.  It's not that nearly half of Americans are
dependent on government; it's actually more than half.  If one includes
not just [people on food stamps and
welfare](http://j.mp/U4bDCi), but also seniors on
Medicare, Social Security and people employed by the government
directly, the number is more like [165 million out of 308
million](http://j.mp/U4bDCj),
which is 53%.

Some argue that Social Security and Medicare benefits are a right
because people pay into these programs their whole lives, or that we
need a government safety net in place for people who fall on hard
times.  However, this all becomes a moot point when the funds people
depend on become worthless due to government default or rampant
inflation.

This is less an issue of dignity or dependence on government, and more
about the
[deceitfulness](http://j.mp/U4bDCk)of
[government promises](http://j.mp/U4bDCl).

The Fed recently announced that it plans to keep interest rates near
zero and keep buying near worthless assets from banks indefinitely. 
This enables Congress to spend without having to take deficits or the
debt seriously and there is every indication they intend to spend with
impunity until the system collapses.  There are no brakes on the runaway
train.  The federal debt ceiling law does nothing to limit spending. The
ceiling will have to be raised yet again perhaps before the year is
out.  What is happening in Greece with austerity measures and riots in
the street [will happen
here](http://j.mp/U4bFu5)within a decade
according to some realistic estimates if we do not find some way to
fiscally restrain our government.

There is little point in a debate about being entitled to healthcare or
food or shelter from fellow taxpayers if the whole system has
collapsed.  And, with the way our politicians have taken over and
[mismanaged vast amounts of
resources](http://j.mp/U4bDCm),
collapse seems almost unavoidable.  Yet the number of Americans who have
significant dependency on government is dangerously high, and I honestly
fear for them.

Worse, [corporate welfare is also at an all time
high](http://j.mp/U4bDCn)with
no signs of diminishing.  Though it is hard to quantify, [Tad Dehaven at
Cato ](http://j.mp/U4bFu8)has estimated that
the government spends nearly twice as much on corporate welfare than on
social welfare.  Both parties are equally guilty.  More and more, the
[business sector is learning to
rely](http://j.mp/U4bDCq) on
taxpayer largesse in one form or another.  They used to be solely
concerned with providing a better product to the consumer at a better
price.  Now, success on Wall Street depends entirely too much on having
the best lobbyists on K Street.  If one includes the employees of
"private" businesses who depend on government contracts, grants or
bailouts, there are even more people dependent on government in some
way.

Government does not create resources when it taxes people and prints
money; it merely redistributes the wealth, while supporting a massive,
wasteful bureaucracy along the way.  Government is a giant,
blood-sucking parasite on our otherwise healthy economy.  For too long
we have entrusted too much economic power and influence to irresponsible
politicians in Washington.  It's the chaos that ensues after they run
the system into the ground that will be so painful for so many people. 
But realigning our economy with the free market and away from government
mandates and handouts must happen in order for it to thrive again. 

The answer is not to keep asking government to do more.  The answer is
to [extricate our
economy](http://j.mp/U4bDCr)
and ourselves from the grasp of Washington DC as much as possible now,
before our dependency becomes our downfall.
