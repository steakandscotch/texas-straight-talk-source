Last year the Chairman of the Federal Reserve told me that [gold is not
money](http://j.mp/U4bDm2), a position which central banks,
governments, and mainstream economists have claimed is the consensus for
decades.  But lately there have been some high-profile defections from
that consensus.  As [Forbes recently
reported](http://j.mp/U4bDm3),
the president of the Bundesbank (Germany's central bank) and two
highly-respected analysts at Deutsche Bank have praised gold as good
money. 

Why is gold good money?  Because it possesses all the monetary
properties that the market demands: it is divisible, portable,
recognizable and, most importantly, scarce - making it a stable store of
value. It is all things the market needs good money to be and has been
recognized as such throughout history.  Gold rose to nearly [\$1800 an
ounce](http://j.mp/U4bFtX)
after the Fed's most recent round of quantitative easing because the
people know that gold is money when fiat money fails.

Central bankers recognize this too, even if they officially deny it. 
Some [analysts have
speculated](http://j.mp/U4bFtY)
that the International Monetary Fund's real clout is due to its large
holdings of gold.  And central banks around the world have increased
their gold holdings over the last year, especially in emerging market
economies trying to protect themselves from the collapse of Western fiat
currencies.

Fiat money is not good money because it can be issued without limit and
therefore cannot act as a stable store of value. A fiat monetary system
gives complete discretion to those who run the printing press, allowing
governments to spend money without having to suffer the political
consequences of raising taxes.  Fiat money benefits [those who create it
and receive it first](http://j.mp/U4bFtZ), enriching
government and its cronies.  And the negative effects of fiat money are
disguised so that people do not realize that money the Fed creates today
is the reason for the busts, rising prices and unemployment, and
diminished standard of living tomorrow.

This is why it is so important to allow people the freedom to choose
stable money.  Earlier this Congress I introduced the Free Competition
in Currency Act (H.R. 1098) to permit people to use gold as money again.
By eliminating taxes on gold and other precious metals and repealing
legal tender laws, people are given the option between using good money
or fiat money. If the government persists in debasing the dollar – as
[money monopolists](http://j.mp/U4bFu2)have always done –
then the people would be able to protect themselves by using
alternatives such as gold that are both sound and stable.

As the fiat money pyramid crumbles, gold retains its luster.  Rather
than being the barbarous relic Keynesians have tried to lead us to
believe it is, gold is, as the Bundesbank president put it, "a timeless
classic."  The defamation of gold wrought by central banks and
governments is because gold exposes the devaluation of fiat currencies
and the flawed policies of government.  Governments hate gold because
the people cannot be fooled by it.
